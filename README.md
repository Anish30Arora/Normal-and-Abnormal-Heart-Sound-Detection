## Normal and Abnormal Heart Sound Classification using Deep Learning

This project classifies normal vs abnormal heart sounds using PCG signals and deep learning architectures (CNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM Combined).
CNN+LSTM achieved the highest accuracy.
Dataset used is of PhysiNet Challenge 2016 - https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2016/1.0.0/
